## Concatenate an array with itself

[Judge System](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/bash-tutorials-concatenate-an-array-with-itself/problem)

Given a list of countries, each on a new line, your task is to read them into an array. Then, concatenate the array with itself (twice) - so that you have a total of three repetitions of the original array - and then display the entire concatenated array, with a space between each of the countries' names.
